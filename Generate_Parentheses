/*
Approach 2: Backtracking
Intuition and Algorithm

Instead of adding '(' or ')' every time as in Approach 1, let's only add them when we know it will 
remain a valid sequence. We can do this by keeping track of the number of opening and closing brackets 
we have placed so far.We can start an opening bracket if we still have one (of n) left to place. 
And we can start a closing bracket if it would not exceed the number of opening brackets.

    void backtrack(vector<string> &ans,string curr,int open,int close,int max)
    {
        if(curr.length()==(2*max))
        {
            ans.push_back(curr);
            return;
        }
        if(open<max)
            backtrack(ans,curr+"(",open+1,close,max);
        if(close<open)
            backtrack(ans,curr+")",open,close+1,max);
    }
    vector<string> generateParenthesis(int n) {
        vector<string> ans;
        backtrack(ans,"",0,0,n);
        return ans;
    }
