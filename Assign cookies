/*Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you 
should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size 
of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can 
assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number 
of your content children and output the maximum number.

Note:
You may assume the greed factor is always positive.
You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.
